AMD64 SysV64 calling convention:
    function argument registers: RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9, XMM0–7, additional arguments are stored RTL on stack

    callee saved: RBX, RBP, R12–R15, it must restore their original values before returning control to the caller.
    All other registers must be saved by the caller if it wishes to preserve their values.

    Integral return values up to 64 bits in size are stored in RAX while values up to 128 bit are stored in RAX:RDX. 
    Floating-point return values are similarly stored in XMM0 and XMM1.

Kernel mode SysCall convention:
    Syscall selector is in RAX
    Function arguments: RDI, RSI, RDX, R10, R8, R9, No arguments are passed on the stack.
    RCX and R11 are clobbered
    SysCall result is returned in RAX, -4095 -> -1 indicates an error.
